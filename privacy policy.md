## Shake Alarm Clock: Privacy policy

Welcome to the FTC Scorer app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Dragos Morar. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

This app collects only your email in order to sign you in. This email is not shared with any company.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Dragos Morar.
